## Features Overview

### **Date Sorting**
Photos are automatically sorted by modification date, showing the newest photos first. This helps you review your most recent work efficiently.

### **Real-Time Statistics**
- **Current Count**: Shows which photo you're viewing (e.g., "Photo 5 of 25")
- **Liked Count**: Tracks how many photos you've liked so far
- **Skipped Count**: Tracks how many photos you've disliked/skipped
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of your progress through the collection

### **Simple Controls**
- **Like Button**: Green button with thumbs up emoji
- **Dislike Button**: Red button with thumbs down emoji
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick navigation without using the mouse

## Tips

- The app automatically handles duplicate filenames by adding a number suffix
- Photos are displayed at a maximum size of 600x400 pixels for optimal viewing
- You can see the current photo's filename and modification date below the image
- The progress bar shows your progress through the photo collection
- The app creates the output folder automatically if it doesn't exist
- Photos are sorted by modification date, so you'll see your newest photos first

## Troubleshooting

**"No photos found" error**: Make sure your input folder contains supported image files and that the folder path is correct.

**"Failed to move photo" error**: This usually occurs if the photo is currently open in another application. Close any applications that might be using the photo and try again.

**Image loading errors**: Some image formats might not be supported or the file might be corrupted. The app will skip these files and continue with the next photo.

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- Python 3.8 or higher
